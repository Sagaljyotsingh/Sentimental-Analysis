Stages Nightclub,2023-11-11T07:55:41Z,Hshshs,"Bouncer with beard has denied entry of over 6 completely sober patrons who have not had a single drink on multiple seperate occasions, using the ""too drunk"" excuse excluding entry of a whole group of POC, and allowing a group of clearly inebriated caucasian teenagers in without verification of identification. at this point this feels like a racial issue is at hand between the security and patrons, and this needs to be rectified immediately as this is the fifth night I should have been allowed in and was denied entry for what appears to be my skin color.",1.0,-0.800000011920929,1.600000023841858
Stages Nightclub,2023-08-21T17:16:06Z,Samantha Decker,"Went in at 11pm paid 10$ for me and my friend for cover , one of the bartenders took a photo of us above the dance floor and we left to go get food quick.we went back in around 11:41 By the time we came back my stamp didn’t glow and the lady was telling me they don’t wash off as her was on for 3 weeks. Clearly mine washed off or wasn’t put on correctly, The bouncer said he remembered my friend but not me, we showed them the TIME STAMPED photo of us in stages that night with the same outfits on less then an hour earlier

We paid an extra $5 to get in and the cover lady was rude and yelling at us.

One of them was literally making fun of me for getting upset. Don’t know why they felt the need to pick on me for wanting my coat, probably bored with their life",1.0,-0.800000011920929,2.5

Stages Nightclub,2023-01-15T18:25:33Z,Not Applicable,"I’ve been going to this place for 9 years now, back in the day it was ran great! Coat check always available, security being actual security and knowing the difference between the rights of guests and workings.
Now it seems they hire security with little to no experience that places power over their job. With a line expanding going into the metro parking lots because they want to let groups of girls cut the line with is compromising the people in the line. I’ve seen not only myself, but other people getting kicked out for standing their ground. If we mention that we noticed they let girls cut, we get threatened to not get let in if we continue to talk about it with the security, told to leave for leaving our jacket in a spot that is secure. ( including over 20+ more jackets) since coat check is not an option any longer, nor has it been with quite some time now which is leading people to find other options to store there jacket. The place gets very hot with the amount of people in the building, so having a thick jacket on is not the healthiest choice.
People get shunned out about tips, not acknowledged, and kicked out for nothing.
You can have a great experience there, if the staff isn’t choosing power over their position, get acknowledged and not kicked out for literally doing NOTHING.
I go to alot of different clubs and I can confidently admit, that this is run by children and not worth spending your money. The security makes the experience not worth it.",1.0,-0.4000000059604645,8.100000381469727

Rude.
Aggressive ""customer"" dudes apparently run the bar. Left after one beer. Strip clubs are supposed to be where we escape stress, not have it piled on.
Bartender's friends were obnoxious and threatening, throwing comments at us from the minute we bought our first beer.
Felt unsafe.
I came to see and spend money on women, not your childhood tree house club.",1.0,-0.5,4.800000190734863

TRINITY SOCIAL,2024-01-21T16:57:37Z,Jesse Cohen,Awful experience here last night. My friend got kicked out because the security confused him for another person. Wouldn’t let us leave with him and made him wait outside in the cold while we grabbed his jacket.  Security guards treated us with disrespect when we didn’t even know what was going on. Someone please teach these security guards how to identify a person and how to use manners.,1.0,-0.699999988079071,3.799999952316284

Stages is way better, the DJ can actually DJ. We all left and went there instead! I am giving this place a 0 star due to the horrible DJ.",1.0,-0.6000000238418579,2.5999999046325684

The Ale House & Canteen,2023-10-31T03:43:31Z,Jacqui Mclellan,"How to ensure your guests have a terrible experience at what was supposed to be an excellent Beaches concert:

Step 1. Have a sticky, dusty, dirty venue that's probably about a clean as a truck stop bathroom.
Step 2. Offer General admission for a popular band. (Not that odd but wait for it.)
Step 3. Let everyone into the venue and allow them to go almost wherever they want because, general admission.
Step 4. Go up to some guests who waited in line for nearly an hour and tell them they have to MOVE because that specific area of the balcony is suddenly reserved.
Step 5. Offer absolutely no resolution for this at all, not even an apology.
Step 6. With the venue now packed expect those guests to just figure it out despite it being obvious that they will not be able to see anywhere else at this point.

All in all the manager at The Ale House ruined what was supposed to be a fun night by being completely unprepared for these supposed, at a general admission concert. Completely lacking in the ability to think creatively he basically just said we, along with several other guests who'd also arrived early, were SOL. He offered no apology, not even a free drink. We specifically picked that section of the balcony to avoid being bumped into to too much due to some physical issues. We managed to make it through about 4 of The Beaches songs before having to leave. I hope bands think twice before booking The Ale House in the future.

As an additional note, half the balcony WAS roped off. But for some reason these reservations HAD to be where we already were. And no they weren't VIP ticket holders. So disappointed",1.0,-0.30000001192092896,11.899999618530273

Although to get in, you need to be a heavy alcoholic.
Cirhosis of the liver is going to be the result of being a guest there.

However, the staff isn't too friendly. The one guy, Marcel is barely understandable. Some weird sort of accent. Maybe even a disability.
